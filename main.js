1) Add three college objects to the myTopThreeColleges object (refer to daily docs if needed).
  Each college must contain:
    a) avgGPA (an integer/float)
    b) avgSAT (an integer)
    c) 3 potential majors you're interested in studying (an array)
*/




/*
2) console.log these statements for each college
  My first choice is COLLEGE NAME. In order to get in, I’ll need an average gpa of AVERAGE GPA.
  Three majors that I’d be interested in studying at COLLEGE NAME are 3 POTENTIAL MAJORS
  (HINT: You'll need to iterate over the array to get to the college names).
*/




/*
3) Change at least one of the majors in one of your favorite colleges (using either dot or bracket notation)
and console.log the following statement.
  After giving it some thought, I think I might be interested in studying 3 POTENTIAL MAJORS at COLLEGE NAME.
*/




/*
4) Wrap the console.logs in a function and call it/log it once for each college in the myTopThreeColleges object.
*/




/*
5) Create a nested object of your choice. It must contain an integer, an array and another object as values.
Iterate over the object and attempt to print out all of the values. Are you able to access the individual values
within the array and the object? See if you can use recursion to log out all elements in the arrray and object as
you iterate over the object. Here’s a hint:
